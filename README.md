# Customer_Churn

**Here is a summary and breakdown of this project:**

Summary:

The project is a machine learning-based approach to predicting telecom customer churn. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately predict which customers are at risk of churning, allowing the company to take proactive measures to retain them.

Modules:

1. Data Preprocessing: This module involves cleaning, transforming, and aggregating the data into a format suitable for modeling.

2. Feature Engineering: This module involves extracting relevant features from the data, including label encoding and one-hot encoding categorical variables.

3. Model Selection and Evaluation: This module involves selecting and evaluating appropriate machine learning algorithms for the task, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting, and K-nearest neighbors.

Tech Stack:

• Programming Language: Python

• Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, CatBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM

• Tools: Jupyter Notebook
